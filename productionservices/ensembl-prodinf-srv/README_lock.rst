Overview
========

The locking service provides a simple interface for processes to request soft read and write locks onto resources during the production process.

Implementation
==============

The locking libraries used can be found in `ensembl-prodinf-core <https://github.com/Ensembl/ensembl-prodinf-core>`_ - for more information please see `locking.rst <https://github.com/Ensembl/ensembl-prodinf-core/blob/master/docs/locking.rst>`_

The locking app itself is a simple flask app (see `lock_app.py <lock_app.py>`_) providing a set of REST endpoints onto the underlying library. After starting the app, full API documentation is available from ``/apidocs``.

Installation
============

First clone this repo

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/Ensembl/ensembl-prodinf-srv
  cd ensembl-prodinf-srv

To install Python requirements using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install ``ensembl_prodinf`` from git - alternatively to reference an existing install to PYTHONPATH e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

  PYTHONPATH=[install_dir]/ensembl-prodinf/ensembl-prodinf-core


Database Setup
==============

Before you can use the lock endpoint, you need to create an empty schema for the resource locks to be stored in. Any tables needed will be automatically created.

Configuration
=============

Configuration is via the config file ``lock_config.py``. The only configuration property is ``LOCK_URI`` which should be the URI for the lock database (see above). You can also set this as an environment variable.

Running
=======

To start the main application as a standalone Flask application:

.. code-block:: bash

  export FLASK_APP=lock_app.py
  cd ensembl-prodinf-srv
  flask run --port 5001 --host 0.0.0.0

or to start the main application as a standalone using gunicorn with 4 threads:

.. code-block:: bash

  pyenv activate ensprod_inf
  cd ensembl-prodinf-srv
  gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5001 lock_app:app

Note that for production, a different deployment option should be used as the standalone flask app can only serve one request at a time.

There are multiple options, described at:

* http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/deploying/wsgi-standalone/
* http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/deploying/uwsgi/

To use a standalone gunicorn server with 4 worker threads:

.. code-block:: bash

  gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5001 lock_app:app

Using Docker
============

To build a Docker image:

.. code-block:: bash

  docker build -t ensembl_prodinf/lock_app -f Dockerfile.hc .

To run your Docker image against a specified hive, exposing the REST service on port 4001 e.g.:


.. code-block:: bash

  docker run -p 127.0.0.1:4001:4001 --env LOCK_URI='mysql://user:pwd@myhost:3306/my_hive_db' ensembl_prodinf/lock_app

Environment variables should be supplied as arguments to the run command as shown in the example above.
